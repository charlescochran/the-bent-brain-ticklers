# Tau Beta Pi "The Bent" F24: Brain Ticklers #2: Magic Beehive
#
#   Assign integers from 1 to 19 to the cells of the beehive such that each of
#   the 15 horizontal and diagonal lines adds to the same total. For ease of
#   scoring, give your answer with the smallest "corner" on the top left and
#   its smallest neighbor in the top middle.
#
# This program solves all possible order-3 magic hexagons
# (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_hexagon).
# Spoiler alert: there's only one! The others are just rotations/reflections.
