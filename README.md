# "The Bent" Brain Ticklers Solutions

The engineering honor society Tau Beta Pi publishes [The
Bent](https://www.tbp.org/bent.cfm), a quarterly magazine. Each issue includes
a series of logic puzzles or Brain Ticklers.

Some of them are difficult to solve by hand, so I have included code written
to solve them here!
